  If you're looking for help or mappacks, or you made a mappack of your own, [the game's forum is here.](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewforum.php?f=8&sid=22f68690172a445d290d953b52074c83)

  If you think you'd prefer Alesan's Entities, you can find it [Here.](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3636) (please don't leave us)
